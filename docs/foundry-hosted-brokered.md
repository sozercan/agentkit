# Foundry hosted brokered Responses mode

AgentKit can expose a Foundry hosted `/responses` surface that pauses on an
Orka-brokered function call and resumes only after Orka returns a
`function_call_output`. This mode is for hosted agents that must let Orka remain
the sole policy, approval, credential, idempotency, and execution authority.

## Security invariant

Hosted AgentKit receives only safe brokered schemas:

- tool name;
- description;
- brokered class: `read`, `write`, or `coordination`;
- JSON parameters schema; and
- optional `schemaDigest` drift metadata.

Hosted AgentKit must never receive Orka Tool execution URLs, Kubernetes Secret
refs, auth headers, bearer tokens, downstream credentials, approval-bypass
metadata, or durable Orka control-plane credentials. Direct AgentKit-owned tools
are not allowed in the same v0 `agent.yaml` as `brokeredTools`; mixed owned-tool
and brokered-tool mode is intentionally deferred. `/invocations` is disabled when
`brokeredTools` are configured so it cannot bypass Orka. The container emits a
Responses `function_call` item and waits for Orka to execute and resume it.

## Static schema configuration

Foundry hosted-agent endpoint-scoped `/responses` calls do not accept dynamic
request-level `tools` in this mode. Instead, bake safe schemas into `agent.yaml`:

```yaml
brokeredTools:
  - name: check-network-telemetry
    description: Read sanitized optical telemetry.
    brokeredClass: read
    parameters:
      type: object
      properties:
        site:
          type: string
      required: [site]
    schemaDigest: sha256:<optional digest generated from the safe schema>
```

The ABI loader rejects unsafe fields such as `url`, `headers`, `secretRef`,
`auth`, and `token`, rejects unknown brokered classes, requires a top-level JSON
Schema `type: object`, and validates `schemaDigest` when present.

## Drift workflow

Orka Tool CRDs remain the source of truth. Deployment tooling should export only
the safe model-facing subset into AgentKit `brokeredTools`. The shared helper
`agentkit_serve_common.brokered.generate_brokered_tools_from_orka_tool_crds` and
its CLI wrapper produce deterministic entries and compute `schemaDigest`; AgentKit
startup fails if a configured digest no longer matches the safe schema in
`agent.yaml`. Orka still validates every live call against current Tool CRDs at
execution time.

Example export command:

```sh
agentkit-brokered-tools ./orka-tools/*.yaml -o brokered-tools.generated.yaml
```

The output is an `agent.yaml` fragment shaped as:

```yaml
brokeredTools:
  - name: check-network-telemetry
    description: Read telemetry.
    brokeredClass: read
    parameters:
      type: object
    schemaDigest: sha256:...
```

Use `--no-digest` only for ad-hoc demos where drift failure is not desired, and
`--bare` when another deployment templater owns the top-level `brokeredTools` key.

## Responses lifecycle

Initial request:

```json
{"input":"please read telemetry"}
```

Deterministic local brokered mode requires the prompt to name exactly one
configured tool whenever multiple tools are configured, and for any non-conformance
single tool. Only the special `conformance_read` smoke-test schema may be selected
without an explicit tool-name mention. If no configured tool name is present when
explicit selection is required, the request is rejected with
`brokered_tool_selection_required` instead of silently choosing the wrong tool. A
real model-adapter implementation must replace this deterministic selection with
model-driven tool choice.

Brokered response:

```json
{
  "status": "completed",
  "output": [
    {
      "type": "function_call",
      "call_id": "call_<response-id>_1",
      "name": "conformance_read",
      "arguments": "{\"probe\":true}",
      "status": "completed"
    }
  ]
}
```

Continuation request:

```json
{
  "previous_response_id": "<response-id>",
  "agent_session_id": "<platform-session-id>",
  "brokered_continuation_proof": "<configured-proof>",
  "input": [
    {
      "type": "function_call_output",
      "call_id": "call_<response-id>_1",
      "output": "{\"approved\":true,\"output\":{\"success\":true}}",
      "status": "completed"
    }
  ]
}
```

Canonical approved payload exposed back to the model:

```json
{"approved":true,"output":{"success":true}}
```

Canonical denied/error payload:

```json
{
  "approved": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "approval_declined",
    "message": "Human declined dispatch-work-order"
  }
}
```

`function_call_output` is privileged continuation input. It is rejected unless a
known `previous_response_id` has a pending matching `call_id` **and** the request
uses the Orka-only continuation path. Configure
`AGENTKIT_FOUNDRY_BROKERED_CONTINUATION_PROOF` and have the Orka hosted-Responses
adapter send it either as `X-AgentKit-Brokered-Continuation-Proof` or as the
top-level JSON field `brokered_continuation_proof`. AgentKit accepts either
candidate so a wrong or stripped header does not override a matching body value.
The proof is never added to model input, persisted response state, or response
payloads. Ordinary client requests must not be able to submit tool results.
Unknown response IDs, unknown call IDs, orphan tool outputs, duplicate conflicts,
malformed outputs, missing or wrong continuation auth, and multiple tool outputs
all return deterministic error envelopes. An identical duplicate continuation
from the broker path returns the same final response idempotently.

The body field is an AgentKit/Orka compatibility extension rather than a standard
OpenAI Responses field. Prove that the target Foundry gateway accepts and forwards
it before relying on this carrier. A static proof in request bodies is suitable
only for bounded demos because platform/request logging can expose replayable
body values; production designs should use a short-lived proof bound to the
response, call, output digest, and expiry.

For Foundry hosted sessions, `agent_session_id` is a gateway routing field. Orka
must capture the platform-returned value from the initial public response and
send it in the continuation body. Inside the container, AgentKit treats
`FOUNDRY_AGENT_SESSION_ID` as the authoritative sandbox identity and uses body,
query, or compatibility-header values only when that hosted identity is absent.
Continuation state with a stored session ID requires the same effective session;
a missing or different identity is rejected with `response_session_mismatch`.
AgentKit does not synthesize or echo a public
`agent_session_id`; Foundry owns that response field.

## Response IDs and state

The adapter uses the Azure hosted Responses SDK ID generator when available, so
new response IDs use the hosted-compatible `caresp_...` form instead of the old
hand-rolled `resp_<uuid>` form.

`/readiness` fails with HTTP 503 when continuation auth is missing and reports
`continuationAuth: missing`; the adapter also refuses to start brokered
function-call responses until the proof is configured.

By default the state backend is in-memory and suitable for deterministic local
smoke and single-replica demos only. Set
`AGENTKIT_FOUNDRY_RESPONSE_STATE_FILE=/path/to/state.json` to persist pending and
completed brokered response state as an atomically rewritten JSON file. For a
Foundry hosted-session smoke, use an already-expanded path under the persisted
session home, such as `$HOME/.agentkit/foundry-response-state.json`, and run one
app process/Uvicorn worker. A literal `$HOME` in an environment value may not be
expanded by the deployment system, so prefer launcher-side `Path.home()` path
construction. The public continuation must still carry the same
`agent_session_id` so Foundry routes it to that sandbox.

An immediate initial/continuation pair proves routing affinity, not file recovery.
To prove persistence, stop the Foundry session between the two requests and show
that a new process reloads the pending state. Configure the state TTL and Orka
approval timeout longer than that test. Deployments without a session-persisted
file, shared file, or platform-managed store must pin one replica or use sticky
routing; otherwise a continuation that lands on a different/restarted container
fails safely with `unknown_previous_response_id`. Pending state expires after
`AGENTKIT_FOUNDRY_RESPONSE_STATE_TTL_SECONDS` (default: 900 seconds); expired
continuations fail with `response_state_expired`. The store is bounded by
`AGENTKIT_FOUNDRY_RESPONSE_STATE_MAX_PENDING` (default: 128), and generated
brokered arguments are bounded by `AGENTKIT_FOUNDRY_BROKERED_MAX_ARGUMENT_BYTES`
(default: 8192) before state is accepted. A platform-managed state backend is
still required before treating multi-replica production as fully supported.
Logical TTL is not secure deletion: expired JSON can remain in a stopped
session's file until the store is loaded and rewritten. State files can contain
tool arguments, model/user history, accepted outputs, and final payloads, and may
be visible through Foundry session-file APIs. Use synthetic data and document the
deployment as single-principal/single-tenant unless explicit Foundry isolation
keys are configured consistently for all requests and session operations.

## Streaming

The current route is non-streaming. If clients send `stream: true`, AgentKit
returns the same normal JSON response rather than SSE. This keeps azd/direct curl
smokes deterministic while making streaming support an explicit future step.

## Troubleshooting

- `invocations_disabled_in_brokered_mode`: call `/responses`; brokered mode disables `/invocations` to avoid direct tool bypass.
- `tools_unsupported`: remove request-level `tools`; use static `brokeredTools`.
- `tool_choice_unsupported`: brokered Foundry mode owns tool selection.
- `brokered_continuation_auth_required`: set `AGENTKIT_FOUNDRY_BROKERED_CONTINUATION_PROOF` before accepting brokered continuations.
- `brokered_continuation_forbidden`: only Orka should send the configured proof in `X-AgentKit-Brokered-Continuation-Proof` or top-level `brokered_continuation_proof`.
- `missing_previous_response_id`: a `function_call_output` cannot start a new run.
- `unknown_previous_response_id`: state is missing, expired/purged, or routed to a
  different replica.
- `response_session_mismatch`: the continuation reached a different effective Foundry session than the one that created the pending response.
- `response_pending_function_call_output`: finish the pending brokered tool call before sending a normal follow-up turn against that response.
- `brokered_tool_selection_required`: name exactly one configured brokered tool in deterministic mode when multiple schemas or any non-conformance single schema are configured.
- `brokered_response_state_full`: too many uncontinued brokered responses are pending. Completed entries are evicted before this error is returned.
- `brokered_arguments_too_large`: generated brokered call arguments exceeded the configured pending-state byte budget.
- `unknown_call_id`: the output did not match the pending function call.
- `conflicting_duplicate_continuation`: the same `call_id` was already completed
  with different output.

## SDK conformance spike app

`agentkit_serve_common.foundry_conformance.create_foundry_conformance_app()` is a
small, production-independent hosted Responses app for Phase A0 smokes. It is
also packaged as the `agentkit-foundry-conformance` console script so the same
app can be used as a hosted container entrypoint. It uses
`azure-ai-agentserver-responses` for request parsing, SDK-assigned `caresp_...`
response IDs, response envelopes, event sequencing, and in-memory response state.
It returns the deterministic `conformance_read` function call on the first
`/responses` request and completes when resumed with the matching
`function_call_output`.

Local runnable entrypoint check:

```sh
uv run --directory runtimes/common --extra dev agentkit-foundry-conformance --dry-run
```

Container entrypoint example for the A0 spike image:

```Dockerfile
ENTRYPOINT ["agentkit-foundry-conformance", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8088"]
```

A minimal deployable container fixture lives in `test/foundry-brokered-conformance/`:

```sh
docker buildx build --builder desktop-linux . \
  -f test/foundry-brokered-conformance/Dockerfile \
  --platform linux/amd64 \
  -t agentkit-foundry-brokered-conformance:test --load --provenance=false
```

Use `test/foundry-brokered-conformance/foundry.agent.yaml.example` as the hosted
agent manifest template; it advertises `responses` protocol version `2.0.0` for
this A0 spike. You can also run the transcript helper against a local container
by setting `AGENT_RESPONSES_ENDPOINT=http://127.0.0.1:18088/responses` and
`AGENT_RESPONSES_BEARER_TOKEN=local-dummy-token`.

For a one-command local pre-deploy smoke of the SDK conformance image, run:

```sh
deploy/foundry/scripts/local_brokered_conformance_container.sh \
  --fixture sdk \
  --platform linux/amd64 \
  --transcript-dir ./foundry-brokered-local-transcript
```

Local proof:

```sh
uv run --directory runtimes/common --extra dev pytest -q tests/test_foundry_conformance.py
```

Live direct-endpoint proof after deployment:

```sh
export AGENT_RESPONSES_ENDPOINT="https://<hosted-agent>/responses"
export AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID="<subscription>"
deploy/foundry/doctor.sh --brokered-conformance
deploy/foundry/scripts/foundry_brokered_conformance.sh conformance_read ./foundry-brokered-transcript
```

The script performs the initial `function_call` request, posts the matching
`function_call_output` continuation with `previous_response_id`, asserts SDK-style
`caresp_...` IDs, and saves request/response JSON plus `summary.json` as a
sanitized transcript. Re-run `python3 deploy/foundry/scripts/verify_brokered_transcript.py <transcript-dir>` to verify archived transcript evidence later. This live transcript is still required before claiming A0
completion; the local test only proves the SDK-hosted contract before deployment.

## Production brokered-only fixture

`test/foundry-brokered-agentkit/` packages the production AgentKit Foundry
brokered path, not the standalone SDK conformance app. It bakes a minimal
`agent.yaml` with static `brokeredTools` and runs:

```sh
agentkit-foundry-brokered --config /agent/agent.yaml --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8088
```

Local proof for this production adapter path:

```sh
docker build . -f test/foundry-brokered-agentkit/Dockerfile -t agentkit-foundry-brokered:local
docker run --rm \
  -e AGENTKIT_FOUNDRY_BROKERED_CONTINUATION_PROOF=local-dev-proof \
  -p 127.0.0.1:18092:8088 \
  agentkit-foundry-brokered:local

AGENT_RESPONSES_ENDPOINT=http://127.0.0.1:18092/responses \
AGENT_RESPONSES_BEARER_TOKEN=local-dummy-token \
AGENTKIT_CONTINUATION_PROOF=local-dev-proof \
AGENTKIT_EXPECTED_CALL_ID=auto \
AGENTKIT_EXPECTED_CALL_ID_PREFIX=call_ \
deploy/foundry/scripts/foundry_brokered_conformance.sh \
  conformance_read ./foundry-brokered-agentkit-transcript
```

Use this fixture when you want to validate AgentKit's generated `call_<response-id>_1`
call IDs and continuation-proof enforcement before pushing a real brokered
AgentKit image. The all-in-one local helper supports this fixture too:

```sh
deploy/foundry/scripts/local_brokered_conformance_container.sh \
  --fixture agentkit \
  --platform linux/amd64 \
  --transcript-dir ./foundry-brokered-agentkit-transcript
```

## Lower-level model-loop fallback

Phase A4/A5 has an opt-in fallback when a high-level framework cannot prove
pause/resume: set `AGENTKIT_FOUNDRY_BROKERED_MODEL_LOOP=1` in Foundry brokered
mode. AgentKit then calls the configured OpenAI-compatible chat-completions
model directly with the static safe `brokeredTools` as function schemas. If the
model requests exactly one configured tool, AgentKit rewrites the model's tool
call id to a stable hosted Responses `call_<response-id>_<sequence>` id and
returns a `function_call` output item for Orka. On the Orka-authenticated
`function_call_output` continuation, AgentKit resumes the model with a `tool`
message and returns the final assistant message.

In this mode AgentKit-owned MCP/direct tools remain disabled; only the static
safe brokered schemas are model-visible. The first implementation intentionally
limits each turn to one brokered tool call and rejects unknown, multiple, or
repeated model tool calls deterministically.

## Implementation status and evidence

This section records the current AgentKit-side evidence against the implementation
plan. It is intentionally explicit about what is locally proven versus what still
requires deployed Foundry/Orka/Fibey state.

| Plan area | Current AgentKit status | Evidence | Remaining gate |
|---|---|---|---|
| Golden hosted Responses fixtures | Implemented locally | `runtimes/common/tests/fixtures/foundry_brokered/*`, `tests/test_foundry_brokered_protocol.py` | Orka repo must consume/verify the same wire shapes. |
| A0 SDK hosted Responses spike | Local SDK app and container fixture implemented | `agentkit_serve_common.foundry_conformance`, `agentkit-foundry-conformance`, `test/foundry-brokered-conformance/`, `tests/test_foundry_conformance.py` | Deploy to Foundry and archive a verified live transcript with `deploy/foundry/scripts/foundry_brokered_conformance.sh`. |
| A1 hosted Responses lifecycle/state | Implemented for deterministic/local brokered mode; file-backed state available for single-writer/sticky deployments | `agentkit_serve_common.foundry.create_foundry_app`, `tests/test_foundry_brokered_protocol.py` | Live Foundry must accept generated response IDs and state/routing constraints must be chosen for deployment. |
| A2 static schemas and drift control | Implemented in Go writer/validator and Python runtime; export CLI added | `brokeredTools` ABI, `agentkit-brokered-tools`, `tests/test_config_validation.py`, `tests/test_brokered_schema.py`, Go config/ABI tests | Orka Tool CRDs must be exported during deployment and current digests verified before live runs. |
| A3 deterministic brokered runtime | Implemented for local/fake hosted protocol integration | deterministic `/responses` brokered path and tests | Live Orka deterministic read/write smoke still required. |
| A4 framework pause/resume decision | Lower-level OpenAI-compatible fallback implemented; high-level framework native hooks remain gated | `agentkit_serve_common.foundry_model_loop`, `AGENTKIT_FOUNDRY_BROKERED_MODEL_LOOP=1`, model-loop tests | Live model smoke for brokered read/write prompts. |
| A5 first real model adapter brokered mode | Fallback model loop can emit/resume brokered calls from static safe schemas | model-loop tests in `tests/test_foundry_brokered_protocol.py` | Deployed real model read and write prompts, including declined/policy/error outcomes. |
| A6 live Orka integration | Not proven in this repo state | Local AgentKit/Foundry side helpers exist | Deploy AgentKit and Orka hosted-Responses adapter; run brokered read/write approval smoke. |
| A7 Fibey | Not started; gates not satisfied | N/A | Requires A3/A5/A6 live gates first, then Fibey schemas/instructions/scenario. |
| A8 hardening/docs/review | Local docs/tests/autoreview complete for current patch | This doc, `docs/agent-abi.md`, `docs/runtime-capabilities.md`; full tests/lint; `$autoreview` clean | Record live transcript and Orka/Fibey validation evidence before final completion. |

Local verification commands used for the current AgentKit patch:

```sh
uv run --directory runtimes/common --extra dev pytest -q
go test ./...
make lint
git diff --check
.agents/skills/autoreview/scripts/autoreview
```

Completion must still be judged against live evidence: this local status matrix is
not a substitute for Foundry accepting `previous_response_id`, Orka brokering the
actual read/write calls, or Fibey completing the end-to-end scenario.
