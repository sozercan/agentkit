# Runtime capabilities

AgentKit keeps runtime feature support explicit. Runtime identity and capabilities
are declared in `pkg/agentkit/runtimes` and mirrored in `runtimes/catalog/*.yaml`;
the catalog consistency test ensures they stay in sync.

Capabilities are feature/protocol flags used by validation, image metadata, and
orchestrator registration before an image build. Unsupported requested features
should fail clearly instead of silently producing a degraded runtime image.

## Capability names

Current and reserved names:

- `stdio-mcp` — stdio MCP servers declared with `tools[].command`.
- `streamable-http-mcp` — remote MCP over Streamable HTTP.
- `foundry-invocations-protocol` — Foundry hosted-agent `/readiness` +
  `/invocations` wrapper.
- `foundry-responses-minimal` — current Foundry `/responses` wrapper: synchronous
  and non-streaming. It supports a deterministic schema-only brokered function-call
  loop when `agent.yaml` contains `brokeredTools`, using hosted-compatible
  response IDs and a memory or optional file-backed continuation store. Do not
  treat this as full Responses parity for background, streaming, polling, cancel,
  or multi-replica platform-managed production state.
- `orka-harness-v1` — observed-mode native Orka `orka.harness.v1` wire protocol over HTTP+SSE (`HealthResponse`, flat `CapabilitiesResponse`, `StartTurnRequest`, `StartTurnResponse`, and `HarnessEventFrame`).
- `orka-observed-tools` — AgentKit-owned tools/MCP execute inside the runtime;
  Orka observes lifecycle/output frames and governs externally.
- `orka-brokered-tools` — reserved for a future mode where Orka brokers tool
  execution and approval frames. Not advertised by default.
- `filesystem-skills` — local filesystem skill sources.
- `mcp-skills` — MCP-backed skill sources.
- `context-provider-search` — external search/RAG context provider.
- `context-provider-memory` — external memory context provider.
- `context-provider-skills` — skills represented through a context-provider ABI.
- `workload-identity-token-auth` — workload identity tokens for tools/resources.
- `model-workload-identity-auth` — workload identity tokens for model calls.
- `otel-export` — OpenTelemetry export support.
- `tool-approval` — tool approval / human-in-the-loop policy support.

Avoid provider-specific resource names such as `foundry-toolbox`; those should map
to generic capabilities such as `streamable-http-mcp` plus deployment-profile env
and auth wiring. Orka-specific names here describe the protocol contract AgentKit
exposes; Orka remains responsible for policy, approval, idempotency, and
side-effect governance.

## Current support

| Runtime | Capabilities |
|---|---|
| `pydantic-ai` | `stdio-mcp`, `streamable-http-mcp`, `foundry-invocations-protocol`, `foundry-responses-minimal`, `orka-harness-v1`, `orka-observed-tools` |
| `microsoft-agent-framework` / `maf` | `stdio-mcp`, `streamable-http-mcp`, `foundry-invocations-protocol`, `foundry-responses-minimal`, `orka-harness-v1`, `orka-observed-tools`, `workload-identity-token-auth`, `model-workload-identity-auth`, `context-provider-skills`, `filesystem-skills`, `mcp-skills`, `context-provider-search`, `context-provider-memory` |
| `langgraph` | `stdio-mcp`, `streamable-http-mcp`, `foundry-invocations-protocol`, `foundry-responses-minimal`, `orka-harness-v1`, `orka-observed-tools` |

Context-provider schemas are capability-gated per runtime; the MAF adapter
currently declares skills, search, and memory support. OTel export, local tool
approval enforcement, log-level observability, and native real-model Orka
brokered-tool adapters remain gated until a runtime and protocol contract declare
support.

The shared runtime package now defines the neutral brokered-tool Interface types
(`BrokeredToolDefinition`, `BrokeredToolCall`, `BrokeredToolResult`,
`ToolBroker`, and `BrokeredRuntimeSession`) so framework adapters have a deep
seam to implement brokered tools. The Orka HTTP skin wires brokered
read/write/coordination and `/continue` behind
`AGENTKIT_ORKA_ENABLE_BROKERED_READ=1`,
`AGENTKIT_ORKA_ENABLE_BROKERED_WRITE=1`, and
`AGENTKIT_ORKA_ENABLE_BROKERED_COORDINATION=1`; default capabilities still
advertise observed mode only. Foundry hosted `/responses` can also exercise a
deterministic brokered function-call loop from static `brokeredTools`. For
A4/A5 fallback validation, `AGENTKIT_FOUNDRY_BROKERED_MODEL_LOOP=1` enables a
lower-level OpenAI-compatible chat-completions loop that exposes static safe
brokered schemas as function tools, emits hosted Responses `function_call`
items, and resumes the model with Orka-provided `function_call_output`. Orka
remains responsible for coordination policy,
quotas, child-task lineage, and namespace/agent authorization. Native framework
adapter brokered hooks are still intentionally gated: today the brokered profiles
are validated through the offline echo/conformance runtime, while real model
adapters should only enable those gates after their native pause/resume/tool-output
hooks have matching conformance coverage.

## Brokered runtime feasibility decisions

| Runtime adapter | Brokered status | Feasibility decision |
|---|---|---|
| `pydantic-ai` | Conformance/demo only | The current gate swaps to `OfflineEchoRuntime` for Orka brokered conformance. Native pydantic-ai brokered support should only be advertised after a real function-tool pause/resume path can submit Orka `ToolCallResult` values back into the running agent without direct-tool bypass. |
| `microsoft-agent-framework` / `maf` | Conformance/demo only | The current gate swaps to `OfflineEchoRuntime`. Native MAF brokered support needs a framework hook for externally brokered tool calls and long approval waits before production advertisement. |
| `langgraph` | Conformance/demo only | The current gate swaps to `OfflineEchoRuntime`. Native LangGraph brokered support is feasible only with explicit graph/tool-output resume state and direct-tool bypass controls. |

These decisions keep checked-in/runtime-rendered Orka facades truthful: observed mode
is the default, while brokered read/write/coordination are conformance-gated and
must not be enabled for real model adapters until the corresponding native hooks
and Orka conformance evidence exist.
